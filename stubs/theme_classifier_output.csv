163,"I want to try and gatherthe unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon,alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to goon that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes usThe heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dreamI kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky withcountless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that…What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Is this really Moso’s house?
 Here he’s a superintendant officer,
 so I thought it’d be a more luxuriousbuilding with gold folding screens.
 Your voices are too loud.
 Lord Moso is a magnificent personwith no self-interests.
 So he lives frugally.
 But you know, he’s an old man
 who’s the second most important guyin the land next to the feudal lord, right?
 He smacks of being really poor.
 Naruto!
 Well well, how shameful of meto present such a poor residence.
 Lord Moso.
 What?!
 This old man like fromsome dumpling shop?
 I’m an old man froma dumpling shop?
 Geez, unbelievable!
 Idiot!
 What’re you doing, Neji?!
 Well, make yourselves comfortable.
 So you are Ninja who came fromthe Village Hidden in Leaves?
 From the right,this is Naruto, Neji and Tenten.
 I hear you encounteredthe Cursed Warrior that appeared
 in Lord Komei’s residence last night.
 Yes.
 So, how did it go?
 Did you figure out the true identityof the Cursed Warrior?
 Yeah, it’s a real ghost.
 Oh, a ghost, huh?
 Don’t be jumping to conclusionson your own.
 But he appears all of a suddenand flies around.
 Yeah, and on top of that,the inside of his armor was empty.
 No matter how bizarre the thing,there’s always a trick.
 I’ll pin down the true identity without fail.
 That is encouraging…
 We have just changed feudal lordsand the public is still anxious.
 Please eliminate the rumors ofthe Cursed Warrior as soon as possible.
 I beg of you.
 Please!
 Tsurucho Yakitori
 Here are your chicken wings.
 Oh, here we go!
 They look tasty!
 Hot!
 That Moso superintendant officerseems like a good guy.
 Yes. It was also Lord Mosowho came to my rescue
 and selected me to be a page.
 The son of the feudal lord succeeds him
 and an excellent superintendant officeroffers him tutelage…
 The government appearsto be stable, but…
 Then why is there a strange rumorgoing around
 about the hauntingof the previous feudal lord?
 There’s probably somebody displeased
 with this dramatic replacementof the feudal lord.
 Do you have any idea who it might be?
 Well, it might be Lord Komei, after all.
 Isn't that the name ofthe tactician you were talking about
 who wanted to become the feudal lord?
 Then why did the Cursed Warriorappear in his residence?
 Perhaps to deflect attention.
 That’s it. 					I bet that’s it.
 All right, since it’s come to this,
 if we can nab that old mancalled Komei or whatever
 and quickly get him to own up…
 Guys, let’s get fired up andget going!
 Idiot. We can’t do somethinglike that without proof.
 He is a tactician of this landmore or less, so.
 Oh man, that’s no fun.
 First, I want to meet Lord Sagi,the feudal lord.
 That’s not possible. Lord Sagidoes not like to meet anybody.
 Don’t be such a stick-in-the-mud.Let us meet him, okay?
 You’re a “nipple” friend, right?
 If you’re going to say that,say, “childhood friend.”
 Huh?
 Can we really meet himin a place like this?
 This lake holds fond memoriesfor Lord Sagi.
 And…for me as well.
 In our young days,
 Lord Sagi always played withhis little sister Lady Toki here.
 He might come here around about todaywith his attendants…
 If we’re lucky.
 It’s up to luck, huh?
 It’s Lord Sagi.
 Lord Sagi, we have arrived.
 Thank you.
 Oh wow…So that’s Lord Sagi, huh?
 He’s cute. He is kind of my liking…
 My watch has remained stoppedsince that time.
 Hey, what’s he doing?
 He’s probably reminiscing.
 The only thing that can comfortLord Sagi’s heart
 is his memories with Lady Toki.
 Byakugan.
 Where is it?
 Where’s this bloodthirsty auracoming from?
 It’s not above ground?
 Could it be, underwater…?
 Assassins! Protect Lord Sagi!
 I don’t think so!
 Who the heck are you guys?
 Damn it!I won’t let you get away.
 Wait, Naruto!
 What is it?
 A letter bomb in the water.
 That was a close one.
 If you’d chased after them as is,you would’ve been totally entangled.
 Settle down.
 Lord Sagi!
 Are you all right?!
 Yes, I’m fine.
 Thank goodness!
 Lord Sagi, these three are Ninjafrom the Village Hidden in Leaves…
 They came to investigatethe true identity of the Cursed Warrior.
 That was unnecessary.I bet it was that  Moso’s idea?
 It was all becausehe was worried for your life, Lord Sagi.
 The fact is, if these peoplewere not here now…
 Silence.
 Y-Yes, my lord.
 Hey-hey, do you really not gethow this guy feels?!
 Chishima was seriouslyworried about you.
 Without his passionate friendship,
 the Hidden Leaf Village wouldn’t havetaken action with that low commission fee.
 I am not obliged.
 How bothersome!
 Say what?!
 Friendship is in the past.
 I became a feudal lord andhe is a mere page.
 We are now standing ondifferent surfaces.
 Say that again! I’ll slug the guywho tramples on friendship--!
 Let it go, Naruto.
 What’re you doing?! Let go of me!
 I have to give guys like thisa good thumping!
 You are talking about a feudal lord!
 It would have been betterhad it pierced my throat.
 Go.
 Yes, my lord.
 Jeez, who does he think he is?!
 Jeez, a feudal lord.
 Please forgive him.
 What? You don’t have a problemwith being told off like that?!
 He wasn’t like that in the old days.
 His father and little sisterdied in succession
 and he became cold-hearted.
 So that’s what it was.
 I’m sure the day will come
 when he will turn back intothe kind-hearted Lord Sagi.
 I don’t know about that.
 The Shuriken from before.
 This is an odd shape.
 Hm? Let me have a look.
 Oh!
 Does it look familiar to youor something?
 Y-Yes. There are no Ninjain the Land of Birds.
 But there are guardsmenreceiving special training.
 Is it a weapon those people use?
 Yes.
 Who commands those guardsmen?
 The person who organizes themis Lord Komei the tactician.
 Say what?!
 Komei again.
 Komei must have originally thought tomislead the public with the Cursed Warrior
 and attempted to createa rift between Lord Sagi and Moso.
 But the relationship betweenthe two is tight.
 And by Moso summoning us here,he probably sensed that the day
 was approaching when the truthbehind the incident would be revealed
 and he plottedto assassinate Lord Sagi.
 If we’ve figured out that much,let’s charge on in--!
 Hold your horses, Naruto.
 We have to find more hard evidence.
 Hey, is that how it is?
 Yeah, that’s how it is.
 Neji, look at that.
 No doubt, it’s Komei!
 To think he’d go out without attendants
 even though the Cursed Warriormight appear.
 All right, let’s follow him.
 This is the temple wherethe Cursed Warrior appeared last night.
 Something smells fishy.
 He’s shown up…!
 Byakugan.
 What’s this?!
 There’s no need to waver anymore!
 Hey! Wait.
 I’ve witnessed the true identityof the ghost!
 Who’s there?
 Hey hey, Komei!
 You’re the one responsiblefor controlling the Cursed Warrior, right?
 What?
 H-Hold it!
 Naruto, get down!
 I did it!
 Damn it! No good.
 This thing’s not just a ghost, after all.
 A tornado?
 I can’t see the Cursed Warrior!
 Byakugan.
 A Shuriken Shadow Clone?!
 8 Trigrams Palm Rotation!
 What’re you letting your mind drift for?!
 Sorry… I never thought a ghost coulduse Ninjutsu.
 It’s not a ghost inside the armor.lt’s a Shinobi.
 And quite a wily one at that.
 This is the same shapeas the shuriken from this afternoon.
 He’s an important witness.Take him alive.
 Leave it to me!
 But we can’t take him alive
 if we don’t do something aboutthat tornado.
 Naruto.
 I’m counting on you!
 Right. I’ll try!
 Tenten, use as many weaponsas possible and draw his attention.
 Roger.
 No good. No effect at all.
 That’s fine. Just keep at it.
 Neji…now!
 Gentle Fist Technique,8 Trigrams 64 Palms.
 8 Trigrams 2 Palms.
 4 Palms.
 8 Palms.
 16 Palms.
 32 Palms.
 64 Palms.
 All right, we did it!
 We’ll find out the true identityfor sure this time.
 Show us your real face.
 What’s this?
 It’s empty again.
 This can’t be!
 Lord Komei, we have seized froma storeroom in your residence,
 one suit of white armor alongwith guardsmen Shuriken.
 We would like you to reportto the magistrate’s office
 as a material witness inthe recent Cursed Warrior incident
 as well as the attempted assassinationof Lord Sagi.
 I have no choice.
 Thank you very much.
 With this, Lord Sagi’s heart shouldsettle down somewhat.
 Case closed.
 Still, they were sure prepared.
 Here an hour has barely passedsince contacting Moso.
 At that time…
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 There was a human presencein tonight’s Cursed Warrior.
 The presence of someone alive.
 A presence?
 But you said you didn’t feel sucha presence in the first Cursed Warrior.
 Yeah.
 Hey, what does that mean?
 In other words, the two Cursed Warriorare separate beings.
 So many things happenon this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed,your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times whenI just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart,I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 How can we go back to the villagewhen there's all this mystery?
 If we're gonna investigate,this has to be it.
 What? Could this black thing be…?
 I get it! We use thisto get through the dark…
 Hey, why did we end upin a place like this?!

48,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Hey you, failure.
 I have two piecesof advice for you.
 First, if you intend to callyourself a Shinobi,
 stop that revolting cheering of yours.
 And second...
 a failure willalways be a failure.
 There's no changing that!
 Do you want to see about that?
 You!
 Naruto, I get where you'recoming from, believe me.
 But all fighting must be doneofficially in a match!
 The failure beats the gifted geniusthrough sheer effort…
 Wouldn't that make foran exciting main battle?
 I promise you.
 I will win no matter what!
 Gaara vs. Rock Lee:The Power of Youth Explodes!
 Hey, Choji!
 You're in trouble.
 Only the strong ones are left.
 Probably the strongest of Hidden Soundmust be that bloke.
 And Lee is apparently strongenough to take on Sasuke!
 And particularly that Sand guy!
 He's probablythe most dangerous one!
 I-I don't care!
 I plan to forfeit right awayif that happens…
 So that means…
 Huh?
 ...you plan to foregoall-you-can-eat BBQ, too, then.
 What? Come on!
 Don’t worry.
 If things start getting ugly,
 I'll step in and stop the fight,like I did for Hinata. Okay?
 Prime beef tongue, short ribs...
 – You can eat what you want.– Don't dangle food in front of him!
 – Besides he didn't step in...– You can eat whatever you want...
 – and stop the fight for Hinata.– and all you want.
 B-B-Q! All right, B-B-Q!All you can eat!
 He doesn't look good.
 Watching the previous fight…
 Did it get stirred up?
 His inner demon!
 I’m curious about that guy, Neji, too…
 Here's a plan.
 Kankuro?
 Just a littleinformation-gathering mission.
 Hey!
 Huh?
 What are you doing hereall by yourself?
 Shouldn't you be with your friends?
 I-It's none of your business, is it?!
 Hmmm. Well, well…
 That guy... Neji Hyuga, right?
 Well, it seems to me that
 he didn't reveal the true extentof his power in that last match.
 What's he about?
 I'm going to crush him!
 Err, that's not whatI was asking.
 Besides, this guy’s way out of his league...
 You seem like a fun guy.I quite like you.
 You're dull.And I don't like you at all!
 I'm going to waste this guy!
 We will now resume the battle.
 Okay!
 You'll be up this time for sure.Go for it, Lee!
 No!
 – Huh? 					– What?
 Seeing as I've come this far,I rather be the last!
 Is Lee sulking?
 Hurry up and get down here…
 Safe!
 – Hey!– Don't do anything misleading, idiot!
 Gaara vs. Rock Lee
 Oh! Lee!
 It worked!
 If you say you want to go last,then you won't be last.
 It's an application of the same law
 that says a stone thrown to hita telephone pole will miss,
 and a stone thrown to misswill be a direct hit!
 Right! That's my student!
 I absolutely did notwant to go last!
 I threw them a beauty of a curve!
 Threw whom a curve?
 Okay, so let me give youa little piece of “nice” advice.
 Right!
 Probably no one has noticed yet, but…
 That gourd is suspicious!
 I see!
 Quit with the notes!
 You're not going to have time toread them during the match! Fool!
 I see!
 He didn't realize that?
 Wow, is Lee going to be all right?
 All right! 					Go! Lee!
 Yeah!
 I am very happy to be squaringoff with you so early in the match.
 I don't know what kind of movesthat bowl-cut guy has,
 but he will never take Gaara.
 Never!
 He's fast, to be sure,but his kick is not all that great.
 No…
 He's... strong!
 Please don't be in such a hurry.
 Lee…
 Be careful, Lee.
 Now then… The 9th match...
 Begin!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Is that…?
 Sand?
 What an unusual Jutsu…
 There's sand in his gourd!
 That's…
 That's it?
 Desert Coffin!
 Desert Burial!
 Not another horror story like that…
 A sand-manipulating Jutsu, eh?
 Sounds like trouble.
 But let's give it a go!
 Even that Lee’s fast strikes…
 have no effect at all!
 What's the deal?!
 No physical strike is going tohave any effect on him.
 What?
 The Sand shields and protects Gaara
 on its own accord, independentlyof any intent on Gaara's part.
 That's why... no one has been ableto do it so far....
 Injure Gaara, that is.
 Curses! He's not movinga muscle and still...!
 Is that it?
 Entertain me a bit more…
 There's not enough yet!
 Blood!
 Why is Lee only using Taijutsu?
 He'll never be able to get closeenough for that!
 Why doesn't he step back a bit anduse Ninjutsu or something?
 It’s not that he doesn't use it.
 He can’t use it.
 Huh?
 Lee has almost no Ninjutsuor Genjutsu skills.
 N-No way!
 When I first met Lee,he was completely inept.
 He had no talent whatsoever.
 What? I can't believe that!
 Hey hey!
 Certainly…
 A ninja who can’t do Ninjutsuand Genjutsu is a rarity.
 That’s why, the only path open to Leeas a Ninja was Taijutsu.
 But! That's precisely whatmakes him a winner!
 Huh?
 Lee, take them off!
 B-But Guy Sensei...!
 You told me only to do that
 to protect a large groupof very important people!
 That’s quite all right!
 I give you permission!
 Are those…?
 Weights?
 That's some cliché training…
 I see!
 Ridiculous!
 All right, now I canmove easily!
 Humph! Does he thinkremoving some measly little weights
 is going to enable him tooutmaneuver Gaara's sand…?
 A bit extreme, I'd say, Guy.
 Go, Lee!
 Right!
 Go!
 Very close!
 Fast!
 Amazing…!
 Because he can't useNinjutsu or Genjutsu...
 Therefore, he channeled allof his time,
 all of his energy and...
 all of his being into Taijutsu.
 Though he can’t do any other Jutsu…
 He won't lose to anyone…
 He is a Taijutsu specialist!
 I can't believe it!Gaara's been injured!
 No way...!
 Bushy-Brows is evenfaster than before!
 Was he this strong?!
 Youth is... explosion!
 Right!
 Over here!
 Good!
 I got him good!
 A-Amazing, he's so fast!
 The Sand Shield can't keepup with him!
 A direct hit!
 A-Amazing.
 His strikes are lightning fast…!
 I can't even track himwith my eyes!
 Uh oh…
 Uh oh is right!
 That black-circles-under-the-eyeguy is taking some serious blows!
 That's not what I meant.
 Huh?
 W-What the…?!
 His face is crumbling right off…!
 His whole body is coveredwith sand….
 There's not a scratch on him!
 W-What’s with this guy?!
 Sure enough, he wasencased in sand, eh.
 But, it's been a long time since
 I've seen that expressionon Gaara's face.
 I felt that he was becomingmore and more unstable
 as the Chunin Exam progressed…
 So Gaara's other self hasbeen awakened, eh?
 Hey! What is that?
 That protected himagainst Bushy-Brow's strikes?
 Yes… It's Sand Armor.
 Armor?
 Ordinarily, the Sand Shieldfunctions to protect him automatically,
 but, if by chance,the Shield is penetrated,
 the Sand Armor functions as a secondlayer of protection against strikes…
 That's Gaara's…absolute defense!
 Well then, there's no wayto get him!
 He doesn't have any weak points.
 No. That’s not entirely true…
 The Sand Armor is actuallyriddled with weak points.
 First of all, because it's not automatic,it uses up a lot of Chakra.
 It's also less effectivethan the Sand Shield,
 and it takes an enormous amountof physical energy
 to keep the sand clingingto the body like that.
 Gaara's having to use the armor...is proof that he's under pressure.
 That Lee is really good…
 But, the outcome of the matchis already a given.
 He will never beat Gaara!
 Is that all?
 But what an incredibledefense he has...
 no amount of speed is goingto let me get a strike through.
 I'll have to do major damagefrom above the sand guard.
 That will be Lotus!
 Yes.
 Be ready!
 A thin sand guard like thatwill be inconsequential
 in the face of Lee's high-speedLotus slamming down from above.
 Hurry up and bring it on!
 You asked for it!
 He didn’t float.
 Not just yet!
 What an amazing series of kicks!
 Even an ordinary Lotus hasa tremendous strain on the body…!
 Lee, let this be the finishing blow!
 Take this!
 Primary Lotus!
 I got him...
 good!
 Right on!
 I-It's over!
 W-What? This can’t be!
 He did it! Lee’s won!
 Hey, he isn't dead, is he?
 Wha--?!
 Huh?!
 What?!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Hey, what happened, Bushy-Brows?!
 All of your strength seemsto have disappeared!
 You're going to be destroyedat this rate!
 But, hey, Bushy-Brows is smiling!
 How can he continue to keep upa fighting stance
 when he's being routed like this?!
