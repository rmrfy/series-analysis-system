163,"I want to try and gatherthe unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon,alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to goon that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes usThe heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dreamI kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky withcountless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that…What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Is this really Moso’s house?
 Here he’s a superintendant officer,
 so I thought it’d be a more luxuriousbuilding with gold folding screens.
 Your voices are too loud.
 Lord Moso is a magnificent personwith no self-interests.
 So he lives frugally.
 But you know, he’s an old man
 who’s the second most important guyin the land next to the feudal lord, right?
 He smacks of being really poor.
 Naruto!
 Well well, how shameful of meto present such a poor residence.
 Lord Moso.
 What?!
 This old man like fromsome dumpling shop?
 I’m an old man froma dumpling shop?
 Geez, unbelievable!
 Idiot!
 What’re you doing, Neji?!
 Well, make yourselves comfortable.
 So you are Ninja who came fromthe Village Hidden in Leaves?
 From the right,this is Naruto, Neji and Tenten.
 I hear you encounteredthe Cursed Warrior that appeared
 in Lord Komei’s residence last night.
 Yes.
 So, how did it go?
 Did you figure out the true identityof the Cursed Warrior?
 Yeah, it’s a real ghost.
 Oh, a ghost, huh?
 Don’t be jumping to conclusionson your own.
 But he appears all of a suddenand flies around.
 Yeah, and on top of that,the inside of his armor was empty.
 No matter how bizarre the thing,there’s always a trick.
 I’ll pin down the true identity without fail.
 That is encouraging…
 We have just changed feudal lordsand the public is still anxious.
 Please eliminate the rumors ofthe Cursed Warrior as soon as possible.
 I beg of you.
 Please!
 Tsurucho Yakitori
 Here are your chicken wings.
 Oh, here we go!
 They look tasty!
 Hot!
 That Moso superintendant officerseems like a good guy.
 Yes. It was also Lord Mosowho came to my rescue
 and selected me to be a page.
 The son of the feudal lord succeeds him
 and an excellent superintendant officeroffers him tutelage…
 The government appearsto be stable, but…
 Then why is there a strange rumorgoing around
 about the hauntingof the previous feudal lord?
 There’s probably somebody displeased
 with this dramatic replacementof the feudal lord.
 Do you have any idea who it might be?
 Well, it might be Lord Komei, after all.
 Isn't that the name ofthe tactician you were talking about
 who wanted to become the feudal lord?
 Then why did the Cursed Warriorappear in his residence?
 Perhaps to deflect attention.
 That’s it. 					I bet that’s it.
 All right, since it’s come to this,
 if we can nab that old mancalled Komei or whatever
 and quickly get him to own up…
 Guys, let’s get fired up andget going!
 Idiot. We can’t do somethinglike that without proof.
 He is a tactician of this landmore or less, so.
 Oh man, that’s no fun.
 First, I want to meet Lord Sagi,the feudal lord.
 That’s not possible. Lord Sagidoes not like to meet anybody.
 Don’t be such a stick-in-the-mud.Let us meet him, okay?
 You’re a “nipple” friend, right?
 If you’re going to say that,say, “childhood friend.”
 Huh?
 Can we really meet himin a place like this?
 This lake holds fond memoriesfor Lord Sagi.
 And…for me as well.
 In our young days,
 Lord Sagi always played withhis little sister Lady Toki here.
 He might come here around about todaywith his attendants…
 If we’re lucky.
 It’s up to luck, huh?
 It’s Lord Sagi.
 Lord Sagi, we have arrived.
 Thank you.
 Oh wow…So that’s Lord Sagi, huh?
 He’s cute. He is kind of my liking…
 My watch has remained stoppedsince that time.
 Hey, what’s he doing?
 He’s probably reminiscing.
 The only thing that can comfortLord Sagi’s heart
 is his memories with Lady Toki.
 Byakugan.
 Where is it?
 Where’s this bloodthirsty auracoming from?
 It’s not above ground?
 Could it be, underwater…?
 Assassins! Protect Lord Sagi!
 I don’t think so!
 Who the heck are you guys?
 Damn it!I won’t let you get away.
 Wait, Naruto!
 What is it?
 A letter bomb in the water.
 That was a close one.
 If you’d chased after them as is,you would’ve been totally entangled.
 Settle down.
 Lord Sagi!
 Are you all right?!
 Yes, I’m fine.
 Thank goodness!
 Lord Sagi, these three are Ninjafrom the Village Hidden in Leaves…
 They came to investigatethe true identity of the Cursed Warrior.
 That was unnecessary.I bet it was that  Moso’s idea?
 It was all becausehe was worried for your life, Lord Sagi.
 The fact is, if these peoplewere not here now…
 Silence.
 Y-Yes, my lord.
 Hey-hey, do you really not gethow this guy feels?!
 Chishima was seriouslyworried about you.
 Without his passionate friendship,
 the Hidden Leaf Village wouldn’t havetaken action with that low commission fee.
 I am not obliged.
 How bothersome!
 Say what?!
 Friendship is in the past.
 I became a feudal lord andhe is a mere page.
 We are now standing ondifferent surfaces.
 Say that again! I’ll slug the guywho tramples on friendship--!
 Let it go, Naruto.
 What’re you doing?! Let go of me!
 I have to give guys like thisa good thumping!
 You are talking about a feudal lord!
 It would have been betterhad it pierced my throat.
 Go.
 Yes, my lord.
 Jeez, who does he think he is?!
 Jeez, a feudal lord.
 Please forgive him.
 What? You don’t have a problemwith being told off like that?!
 He wasn’t like that in the old days.
 His father and little sisterdied in succession
 and he became cold-hearted.
 So that’s what it was.
 I’m sure the day will come
 when he will turn back intothe kind-hearted Lord Sagi.
 I don’t know about that.
 The Shuriken from before.
 This is an odd shape.
 Hm? Let me have a look.
 Oh!
 Does it look familiar to youor something?
 Y-Yes. There are no Ninjain the Land of Birds.
 But there are guardsmenreceiving special training.
 Is it a weapon those people use?
 Yes.
 Who commands those guardsmen?
 The person who organizes themis Lord Komei the tactician.
 Say what?!
 Komei again.
 Komei must have originally thought tomislead the public with the Cursed Warrior
 and attempted to createa rift between Lord Sagi and Moso.
 But the relationship betweenthe two is tight.
 And by Moso summoning us here,he probably sensed that the day
 was approaching when the truthbehind the incident would be revealed
 and he plottedto assassinate Lord Sagi.
 If we’ve figured out that much,let’s charge on in--!
 Hold your horses, Naruto.
 We have to find more hard evidence.
 Hey, is that how it is?
 Yeah, that’s how it is.
 Neji, look at that.
 No doubt, it’s Komei!
 To think he’d go out without attendants
 even though the Cursed Warriormight appear.
 All right, let’s follow him.
 This is the temple wherethe Cursed Warrior appeared last night.
 Something smells fishy.
 He’s shown up…!
 Byakugan.
 What’s this?!
 There’s no need to waver anymore!
 Hey! Wait.
 I’ve witnessed the true identityof the ghost!
 Who’s there?
 Hey hey, Komei!
 You’re the one responsiblefor controlling the Cursed Warrior, right?
 What?
 H-Hold it!
 Naruto, get down!
 I did it!
 Damn it! No good.
 This thing’s not just a ghost, after all.
 A tornado?
 I can’t see the Cursed Warrior!
 Byakugan.
 A Shuriken Shadow Clone?!
 8 Trigrams Palm Rotation!
 What’re you letting your mind drift for?!
 Sorry… I never thought a ghost coulduse Ninjutsu.
 It’s not a ghost inside the armor.lt’s a Shinobi.
 And quite a wily one at that.
 This is the same shapeas the shuriken from this afternoon.
 He’s an important witness.Take him alive.
 Leave it to me!
 But we can’t take him alive
 if we don’t do something aboutthat tornado.
 Naruto.
 I’m counting on you!
 Right. I’ll try!
 Tenten, use as many weaponsas possible and draw his attention.
 Roger.
 No good. No effect at all.
 That’s fine. Just keep at it.
 Neji…now!
 Gentle Fist Technique,8 Trigrams 64 Palms.
 8 Trigrams 2 Palms.
 4 Palms.
 8 Palms.
 16 Palms.
 32 Palms.
 64 Palms.
 All right, we did it!
 We’ll find out the true identityfor sure this time.
 Show us your real face.
 What’s this?
 It’s empty again.
 This can’t be!
 Lord Komei, we have seized froma storeroom in your residence,
 one suit of white armor alongwith guardsmen Shuriken.
 We would like you to reportto the magistrate’s office
 as a material witness inthe recent Cursed Warrior incident
 as well as the attempted assassinationof Lord Sagi.
 I have no choice.
 Thank you very much.
 With this, Lord Sagi’s heart shouldsettle down somewhat.
 Case closed.
 Still, they were sure prepared.
 Here an hour has barely passedsince contacting Moso.
 At that time…
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 There was a human presencein tonight’s Cursed Warrior.
 The presence of someone alive.
 A presence?
 But you said you didn’t feel sucha presence in the first Cursed Warrior.
 Yeah.
 Hey, what does that mean?
 In other words, the two Cursed Warriorare separate beings.
 So many things happenon this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed,your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times whenI just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart,I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 How can we go back to the villagewhen there's all this mystery?
 If we're gonna investigate,this has to be it.
 What? Could this black thing be…?
 I get it! We use thisto get through the dark…
 Hey, why did we end upin a place like this?!

48,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Hey you, failure.
 I have two piecesof advice for you.
 First, if you intend to callyourself a Shinobi,
 stop that revolting cheering of yours.
 And second...
 a failure willalways be a failure.
 There's no changing that!
 Do you want to see about that?
 You!
 Naruto, I get where you'recoming from, believe me.
 But all fighting must be doneofficially in a match!
 The failure beats the gifted geniusthrough sheer effort…
 Wouldn't that make foran exciting main battle?
 I promise you.
 I will win no matter what!
 Gaara vs. Rock Lee:The Power of Youth Explodes!
 Hey, Choji!
 You're in trouble.
 Only the strong ones are left.
 Probably the strongest of Hidden Soundmust be that bloke.
 And Lee is apparently strongenough to take on Sasuke!
 And particularly that Sand guy!
 He's probablythe most dangerous one!
 I-I don't care!
 I plan to forfeit right awayif that happens…
 So that means…
 Huh?
 ...you plan to foregoall-you-can-eat BBQ, too, then.
 What? Come on!
 Don’t worry.
 If things start getting ugly,
 I'll step in and stop the fight,like I did for Hinata. Okay?
 Prime beef tongue, short ribs...
 – You can eat what you want.– Don't dangle food in front of him!
 – Besides he didn't step in...– You can eat whatever you want...
 – and stop the fight for Hinata.– and all you want.
 B-B-Q! All right, B-B-Q!All you can eat!
 He doesn't look good.
 Watching the previous fight…
 Did it get stirred up?
 His inner demon!
 I’m curious about that guy, Neji, too…
 Here's a plan.
 Kankuro?
 Just a littleinformation-gathering mission.
 Hey!
 Huh?
 What are you doing hereall by yourself?
 Shouldn't you be with your friends?
 I-It's none of your business, is it?!
 Hmmm. Well, well…
 That guy... Neji Hyuga, right?
 Well, it seems to me that
 he didn't reveal the true extentof his power in that last match.
 What's he about?
 I'm going to crush him!
 Err, that's not whatI was asking.
 Besides, this guy’s way out of his league...
 You seem like a fun guy.I quite like you.
 You're dull.And I don't like you at all!
 I'm going to waste this guy!
 We will now resume the battle.
 Okay!
 You'll be up this time for sure.Go for it, Lee!
 No!
 – Huh? 					– What?
 Seeing as I've come this far,I rather be the last!
 Is Lee sulking?
 Hurry up and get down here…
 Safe!
 – Hey!– Don't do anything misleading, idiot!
 Gaara vs. Rock Lee
 Oh! Lee!
 It worked!
 If you say you want to go last,then you won't be last.
 It's an application of the same law
 that says a stone thrown to hita telephone pole will miss,
 and a stone thrown to misswill be a direct hit!
 Right! That's my student!
 I absolutely did notwant to go last!
 I threw them a beauty of a curve!
 Threw whom a curve?
 Okay, so let me give youa little piece of “nice” advice.
 Right!
 Probably no one has noticed yet, but…
 That gourd is suspicious!
 I see!
 Quit with the notes!
 You're not going to have time toread them during the match! Fool!
 I see!
 He didn't realize that?
 Wow, is Lee going to be all right?
 All right! 					Go! Lee!
 Yeah!
 I am very happy to be squaringoff with you so early in the match.
 I don't know what kind of movesthat bowl-cut guy has,
 but he will never take Gaara.
 Never!
 He's fast, to be sure,but his kick is not all that great.
 No…
 He's... strong!
 Please don't be in such a hurry.
 Lee…
 Be careful, Lee.
 Now then… The 9th match...
 Begin!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Is that…?
 Sand?
 What an unusual Jutsu…
 There's sand in his gourd!
 That's…
 That's it?
 Desert Coffin!
 Desert Burial!
 Not another horror story like that…
 A sand-manipulating Jutsu, eh?
 Sounds like trouble.
 But let's give it a go!
 Even that Lee’s fast strikes…
 have no effect at all!
 What's the deal?!
 No physical strike is going tohave any effect on him.
 What?
 The Sand shields and protects Gaara
 on its own accord, independentlyof any intent on Gaara's part.
 That's why... no one has been ableto do it so far....
 Injure Gaara, that is.
 Curses! He's not movinga muscle and still...!
 Is that it?
 Entertain me a bit more…
 There's not enough yet!
 Blood!
 Why is Lee only using Taijutsu?
 He'll never be able to get closeenough for that!
 Why doesn't he step back a bit anduse Ninjutsu or something?
 It’s not that he doesn't use it.
 He can’t use it.
 Huh?
 Lee has almost no Ninjutsuor Genjutsu skills.
 N-No way!
 When I first met Lee,he was completely inept.
 He had no talent whatsoever.
 What? I can't believe that!
 Hey hey!
 Certainly…
 A ninja who can’t do Ninjutsuand Genjutsu is a rarity.
 That’s why, the only path open to Leeas a Ninja was Taijutsu.
 But! That's precisely whatmakes him a winner!
 Huh?
 Lee, take them off!
 B-But Guy Sensei...!
 You told me only to do that
 to protect a large groupof very important people!
 That’s quite all right!
 I give you permission!
 Are those…?
 Weights?
 That's some cliché training…
 I see!
 Ridiculous!
 All right, now I canmove easily!
 Humph! Does he thinkremoving some measly little weights
 is going to enable him tooutmaneuver Gaara's sand…?
 A bit extreme, I'd say, Guy.
 Go, Lee!
 Right!
 Go!
 Very close!
 Fast!
 Amazing…!
 Because he can't useNinjutsu or Genjutsu...
 Therefore, he channeled allof his time,
 all of his energy and...
 all of his being into Taijutsu.
 Though he can’t do any other Jutsu…
 He won't lose to anyone…
 He is a Taijutsu specialist!
 I can't believe it!Gaara's been injured!
 No way...!
 Bushy-Brows is evenfaster than before!
 Was he this strong?!
 Youth is... explosion!
 Right!
 Over here!
 Good!
 I got him good!
 A-Amazing, he's so fast!
 The Sand Shield can't keepup with him!
 A direct hit!
 A-Amazing.
 His strikes are lightning fast…!
 I can't even track himwith my eyes!
 Uh oh…
 Uh oh is right!
 That black-circles-under-the-eyeguy is taking some serious blows!
 That's not what I meant.
 Huh?
 W-What the…?!
 His face is crumbling right off…!
 His whole body is coveredwith sand….
 There's not a scratch on him!
 W-What’s with this guy?!
 Sure enough, he wasencased in sand, eh.
 But, it's been a long time since
 I've seen that expressionon Gaara's face.
 I felt that he was becomingmore and more unstable
 as the Chunin Exam progressed…
 So Gaara's other self hasbeen awakened, eh?
 Hey! What is that?
 That protected himagainst Bushy-Brow's strikes?
 Yes… It's Sand Armor.
 Armor?
 Ordinarily, the Sand Shieldfunctions to protect him automatically,
 but, if by chance,the Shield is penetrated,
 the Sand Armor functions as a secondlayer of protection against strikes…
 That's Gaara's…absolute defense!
 Well then, there's no wayto get him!
 He doesn't have any weak points.
 No. That’s not entirely true…
 The Sand Armor is actuallyriddled with weak points.
 First of all, because it's not automatic,it uses up a lot of Chakra.
 It's also less effectivethan the Sand Shield,
 and it takes an enormous amountof physical energy
 to keep the sand clingingto the body like that.
 Gaara's having to use the armor...is proof that he's under pressure.
 That Lee is really good…
 But, the outcome of the matchis already a given.
 He will never beat Gaara!
 Is that all?
 But what an incredibledefense he has...
 no amount of speed is goingto let me get a strike through.
 I'll have to do major damagefrom above the sand guard.
 That will be Lotus!
 Yes.
 Be ready!
 A thin sand guard like thatwill be inconsequential
 in the face of Lee's high-speedLotus slamming down from above.
 Hurry up and bring it on!
 You asked for it!
 He didn’t float.
 Not just yet!
 What an amazing series of kicks!
 Even an ordinary Lotus hasa tremendous strain on the body…!
 Lee, let this be the finishing blow!
 Take this!
 Primary Lotus!
 I got him...
 good!
 Right on!
 I-It's over!
 W-What? This can’t be!
 He did it! Lee’s won!
 Hey, he isn't dead, is he?
 Wha--?!
 Huh?!
 What?!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Hey, what happened, Bushy-Brows?!
 All of your strength seemsto have disappeared!
 You're going to be destroyedat this rate!
 But, hey, Bushy-Brows is smiling!
 How can he continue to keep upa fighting stance
 when he's being routed like this?!

 Naruto…!
 He came in totally late.
 Hmm? Where’s Sasuke?
 The Dosu guy I’m supposedto fight isn’t here, either.
 Hey, you guys over there.
 Throw out your chests andshow your faces to the spectators!
 You guys are the starsof this “final round”!
 Sasuke hasn’t been found yet?
 A team of several Anbu membersare searching all over,
 but they have found nothing.
 He might already be inthe hands of Orochimaru…
 If that’s the case,we may never find him.
 I understand.
 Well-well… Lord Kazekage.
 You must be tired havingcome all this way.
 No…I’m glad the arenais in the Leaf Village.
 Even though you’re still young, it wouldprobably be a tough journey for you
 if you had to go to the troubleof traveling someplace else.
 Shouldn’t you decide onthe Fifth Hokage soon?
 Please don’t treat melike an old person.
 I’m still planning onbeing Hokage for another five years…
 Now then, I guess it’sabout time to begin.
 Everyone, thank you very muchfor coming
 to the Village Hidden in LeavesChunin Exam.
 We will now begin the“final round” matches
 for the eight who made itthrough the preliminaries!
 Please watch until the end!
 If there are supposed to be eight,it looks like there’s one missing.
 I have something to tellyou before the match.
 Look at this.
 Huh?!
 There was a slight changeto the tournament.
 Check who you’ll be facingone more time.
 Here, I had more preliminarymatches than the others…
 So the Dosu guy dropped out?
 I thought I’d pound you here…
 If I did that,there’d be the possibility for me,
 as the one remaining afterthe first battle, to fight Sasuke.
 W-What are you?!
 Say…
 …say.
 What?
 Umm…Sasuke still hasn’t come.
 What’ll happen?
 I wonder if Sasuke really did sneak outof the hospital room at that time.
 Something could’ve happened to him…
 In case a competitor does not arriveby the start time of his match…
 he or she will lose by default!
 It doesn’t make sense.
 Knowing his character,he’d come even if he had to drag himself.
 Where are you going, Gaara?
 To verify my existence…one more time.
 One more time.
 What’s wrong?You should still be able to move, right?!
 Sasuke! Come on!
 Could it be…?
 Even after I warned him to avoiddoing anything to stand out…
 He didn’t kill that Sasuke Uchihaalso, did he…?
 Listen up, you guys.
 The terrain is different,but the rule is that there are no rules,
 the same asin the preliminaries.
 The matches will continue until oneor the other dies, or acknowledges defeat.
 However, if I judge that it has been settled,I’ll stop the match there.
 Arguments will not be allowed.
 Understood?
 So the first match is…
 Naruto Uzumaki.
 Neji Hyuga.
 Just those two remain andthe rest of you go to the waiting room.
 Byakugan vs. Shadow Clone!
 Hey, Hinata! These seats are open.
 Uh-huh.
 This match will be quite interesting!
 Naruto…
 Say, Sakura.
 I understand that you’re worriedabout Sasuke.
 But why don’t you cheerfor Naruto at least a little bit?
 Hmm. You’re right.
 That being said,
 with Neji as his opponent,Naruto has no chance of winning.
 That is…!
 Not so, is what you’regoing to say?
 But to think that brat wouldsurvive until this point…
 I wonder if this isas far as it goes
 for those who survivedjust by luck, after all.
 That Naruto.
 This is not a good opponent at all.
 No matter how you look at it,he can’t beat the Hyuga clan.
 Well, that’s what I thoughtat the beginning…
 But you’ll all be surprisedif you underestimate him.
 Akamaru, what’s wrong?
 What did you say?!
 What?! Where?!
 There!
 What’s Anbu, the Black Ops,doing here?
 Is something going on…?
 You seem like you wantto say something.
 I said it before, too, didn’t I?
 A failure is a failure.You can’t change.
 I promise …
 I’ll win, no matter what!
 He has the look…of being sure of himself…
 It’s as if he’s not all worked up…
 That makes itmore worthwhile for me.
 I look forward to your lookof disappointment…
 when you know the true reality…
 Stop whining.
 Let’s…get started!
 Now then, round one.
 Begin!
 Watch carefully, Hanabi.
 Nobody has inherited sucha strong Hyuga Kekkei Genkai.
 To say nothing of your older sister.
 More than big sister?
 Perhaps more than you, too.
 This time, it’s not an opponentthat can be managed easily.
 He has that Byakugan.
 Close combat is no good…
 Does Naruto know that?
 Idiot! Why would anyoneattack from the front?!
 No! Naruto.
 The opponent can seeyour Chakra Points!
 They're called Chakra Points.
 If those pressure pointsare pressed accurately…
 the flow of an opponent’s Chakracan be stopped,
 amplified or controlled at will.
 Uh-oh!
 I missed, huh…?
 In other words, he’ll pressthe pressure point if I get too close
 and I’ll become unableto use Jutsu.
 That means all I can dois fight from a distance.
 You understand, right?You have no way of winning.
 Heh… All I did was to verify your power.
 The real fight is just getting started!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 You used your head,didn’t you, Naruto?!
 With the Shadow Clone Jutsu…
 Heh. He’s an interesting kid.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu isa Jonin level technique.
 To think he could usesuch an Jutsu…
 Who knows how this’ll turn out?
 Shadow Clone Jutsu?!
 I get it. If Chakra is evenly distributedamong the clones,
 indeed, I can’t detect thereal one even with my Byakugan.
 But there’s only one real one,after all!
 Heh. Don’t be acting tough!
 If you’re going to come,then come.
 It’s pointless.
 In front of that Neji’s defense,it’s not just all attacking.
 Hey!
 Don’t…you…underestimate…
 …me!
 Here they come!
 He hit!
 Fool.
 Wha--?!
 Dang it!
 I’ll get you next time!
 Here!
 This guy…
 Does he have eyes behind him…?
 You’re going to become…the Hokage…?
 With this level, it’s impossible.
 I can generally tellwith these eyes…
 Intrinsic abilities are set.
 Figuratively speaking,everything inherent about people is set.
 Why…?
 Why are you always sojudgmental like that?
 Then…are you going to saythat anybody can become the Hokage…
 if they just work hard?
 Only a very small percentage ofShinobi are chosen to be the Hokage!
 Look more at reality!
 Those who become the Hokageare born with a destiny.
 It’s not something you becomeby trying to become it.
 It’s determined by destiny.
 People must live withintheir different respective currents
 that can’t be defied.
 The one single…destiny everyone has equally…
 ...is death.
 Those eyes…
 He still holds a grudgeagainst the head family, huh?
 So…
 So what?!
 I don’t know when to give up!Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling,so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
 One! Bodimahattaya-san devoteshis time for digging black ships
 Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
 Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
 Four! Japanese people,now lend me you hand!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling,so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling,so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
 Darn it! What is going on?!
 It was clear that my punch got him,but I’m the one who was thrown!
 Darn it!Even though I promised Hinata….
 I really cannot lose ata place like this!
 The next hit will be the big onethat I’m gonna give him!
 Just prepare for it!
 Next time, “Ultimate Defense:Zero Blind Spot!”
 I hardly give up things!

 I just want to conveymy simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with youand live for the moment
 Still that incidentwill continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind,let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realizethat it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks,creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortexand melting away
 But thank goodnessyour injury wasn’t serious.
 Naruto was relieved, too…
 The rumors were true…
 That the survivor of the Village’shonorable Uchiha Clan
 was the most good-for-nothing kid…
 Sasuke, you must be hungry.ls there something you want to eat?
 I’ll go buy something for you.
 The Battle Begins:Naruto vs. Sasuke
 To be honest,I really don’t understand.
 It seems there were opinions that,
 with the final exam being suspended,
 no one should passthis time around.
 But I hear the late Third Hokagehighly praised your match.
 It seems he intended to recommend youfor Chunin.
 The lords of other landswho observed the fight
 and the proctors were ofthe same opinion as well…
 In that case, it’s not in my placeto say this or that about it.
 From now on,
 strive to perform in a mannerthat is worthy of that headband…
 Congratulations!As of today, you’re a Chunin!
 – Wow… 					– Wow!
 Even you who’s never motivatedlook respectable.
 It doesn’t suit you.
 Don’t laugh, I say…
 For the time being,
 let’s have a toast to celebrateShikamaru’s promotion to Chunin!
 Let’s eat!
 Oh! Choji!
 Don’t eat the meat before the toast!
 But, it’d be a waste if it got burned, so…
 There’s a lot of meat. Eat up!
 All right!
 Right now,I have no interest in you…
 Your target is Naruto, after all.
 You’ll end up in the hospital again, Choji.
 Don’t you know how to savor the taste?
 Never mind!
 Even if I eat a lot,I know how to savor properly.
 Hey! Choji, that’s the last piece of meatthat I’ve been grilling!
 The last bite!
 This is the conclusion and
 will become the meat withthe greatest value that should be savored!
 I won’t hand overthis last bite to anyone!
 What’re you acting cool for,you idiot?!
 Everyone makes fun of youbecause you’re like this!
 – You’re just a fa--– Ino!
 That’s a taboo word!
 But really, Choji…
 A meal isn’t a battle.
 Relax at a time like this at least.What a pain.
 Vulgar... Dirty-mouthed…Too lazy…
 I wonder if these guyswill be okay from here.
 In particular…
 Choji. With you it’s nothing but food.
 Do a little training sometime!
 Choji…
 You’re lucky that your minddoesn’t restrict what you eat…
 I’ve got it rough with a diet.
 Why do you have to diet, Ino?
 Girls want to be seen as cute as possibleby the one they like!
 But that person might not alwayslike a thin person.
 In the first place,most boys don’t like fa--
 Not that… They like thin girls.
 And, vice-versa.
 You should be a little more consciousof your body, Choji.
 You won’t be popular.
 Heh… She doesn’t get it.
 Men don’t like thin womenas much as women think.
 More likely men who like chubby womenare the most common.
 And, vice-versa…I’d say.
 I bet she’d be twice as popular
 if she were to gain a little more weightinstead of dieting.
 You sure are a funny guy, Shikamaru.
 And you’re smart, too.
 Hmm?
 I know it in my heart…
 You’re much more awesomethan the likes of Sasuke or Neji.
 Well, I’ve never even thought about that.I’m me, so…
 But you’re the only onewho became a Chunin
 in the Chunin Exam this time…
 But you might be betterat fighting, right?
 I might’ve given up ifI’d gotten into one with you.
 But earlier,Sensei told me that all I do is eat
 and that I’m not progressing…
 I’m me, I tell you. And you’re you.
 It’s stupid talking about how which is.
 Well, don’t worry too muchabout what Asuma says…
 You should live naturallyand take things easy.
 See you later! I’m going home.
 My dad’s starting to saysome troublesome thing
 like he’s going to teach mea new Jutsu or something.
 Shikamaru.
 Hmm?
 What?
 Good luck with your training.
 Yeah.
 You’re a good guy…Choji.
 Hey, Sakura!
 Naruto!
 The time is right…
 Head for the Leaf Village, now!
 I see… You’ve made up your mind, huh?
 Yes!
 I’m carrying out fitness trainingto get ready for the surgery.
 I want to return as soon asI can after the surgery, so…
 Oww!
 Ow-ow…
 Lee…
 Yes?! What is it?
 You won’t dieif you give up being a Shinobi.
 Why are you so fixatedon being a Shinobi?
 My everything is proving thateven I can become a fine Ninja…
 You might die. Even if you succeed…
 Even so…
 I promise you!
 That’s my dream, so…
 Why…do you snap this muchat the mention of Hokage’s name?
 Unlike you…
 I will be the heir to the nameof Hokage, no matter what!
 Because, Hokage is my dream!
 In this village, promising childrenare being brought up.
 Sarutobi Sensei… Sure enough,you were a wonderful Hokage.
 The surgery is in the afternoon.Get ready!
 Let’s go, Lee! Are you prepared?!
 Yes!
 I got some apples…You like them, right?
 Here, doesn’t it look good?
 Huh…? I wonder where I put the knife…
 It’s right in front of you, believe it.
 It’s so lame, you getting all scatterbrainedjust because you’re in front of Sasuke.
 I’d rather hear lamefrom anyone but you…
 Naruto…
 U-zu-ma-ki!
 Naruto 2K Barrage!
 Knock it off already!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 I will…protect Sakura!
 I-I give up, believe it…
 Sasuke… Thank you.
 You rescued me fromthe Sand Ninja, right?
 No...
 The person who rescued you…was Naruto.
 You are weak.
 Why are you weak…?
 It’s because you don’t have enough…
 ...hate.
 Good. I peeled it nicely.
 I’ll cut it to make it easy to eat, and…
 Here, Sasuke.
 Ow! What happened?
 S-Sasuke?
 Huh? What’s going on?
 Wh-What?
 Y-You don’t have to glareat me like that.
 Hey, Naruto…
 Wh-What is it?
 Fight me… Right now!
 What?! Here you are,just treated by Old Lady Tsunade.
 What’re you saying?
 Just fight!
 Sasuke…
 You think you saved me?
 I don’t care if she’s the Fifth Hokageor whatever, but…
 she should’ve just mindedher own business!
 What?!
 You said you wanted to fight me, right?
 I’m saying let’s do it now!
 Or have you chickened out?
 S-Sasuke. Hey…What’s going on?!
 Naruto, you say something too!
 What’s this all of a sudden?
 This is perfect, believe it!
 I was just thinkingI wanted to fight you!
 S-Stop it, the both of you… Okay?
 Come with me!
 What’s…this feeling?My lower belly feels tight…
 I want to fight you, too.
 And… I feel a thrill.
 What’s so funny?
 Nothing’s funny, believe it!I’m happy!
 When I thinkI can finally beat you here!
 Abducting Naruto is the No.1 priorityof our organization, Akatsuki.
 What did you say?Don’t talk foolish, you failure!
 I’m not going to bea failure forever!
 Right now,I have no interest in you…
 You… A loser like you betternot act all high and mighty!
 Hah! It’s unlike you to loseyour cool and raise a fuss.
 So uncharacteristic.
 It couldn’t be that you picked a fightand then got scared, could it, Sasuke?
 Just bring it, now!
 Put on your headband before that!I’ll wait.
 I don’t need such a thing…
 Just do it!
 You wouldn’t even be able…to put one knick on my forehead!
 You’re wrong!
 I’m saying this is a testament to fightingon equal terms as a Leaf Shinobi!
 And I’m saying stuff like thatis acting high and mighty!
 Do you think that we’re equal?!
 Yeah, I do! I’ve never oncethought that I’m inferior to you!
 You’re an eyesore!
 That’s because you remain weak!Little Sasuke!
 Naruto!
 Sasuke!
 Don’t be getting carried away!
 Naruto…
 Enough already, believe it!
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 U-zu-ma-ki!
 Naruto Barrage!
 The Tiger Seal!

 After becoming a Three-Man Squad,though we had fights,
 we carried out our missions together.
 And yet, both Sasuke and Narutohave steadily gone on ahead
 and only I've been left behind.
 Say, Sasuke, I feel you at a distanceeven though you're this close.
 No matter what,I can't see you, Sasuke.

 Bushy Brow's Jutsu: Sasuke Style!
 Hey Guy! You too, Lee…
 Is your body all right?
 Kakashi!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Oh! Sorry, sorry.
 You must’ve been worried.Sorry for not contacting you at all…
 Oh no, Sakura’s gonna get really mad…
 I don’t really mind that.
 It's hard to see from here…
 Sasuke…
 Kakashi Sensei…
 Hm?
 You know about the markon Sasuke’s neck, don’t you?
 Is that…?
 No need to worry.
 A mark?
 So, that’s that.
 Yup!
 One…
 Two…
 Three…
 Four…
 Five…
 Six…
 Seven…
 Eight.
 Eight of them…
 There are eight members ofAnbu Black Ops in this spacious arena…
 Two platoons are too few…
 What’s Lord Hokage thinking?
 Well…without knowing how or whenthe opponent would make their move…
 It can’t be helped that the Anbuare dispersed and deployed
 in important areas in the village.
 Huh?
 It’s about to begin.
 We shouldn’t let our guard down,but for now…
 We need to pay attention… to this match.
 Kakashi, I’ll be carefully checking outwhat sort of training you gave him…
 as your eternal rival!
 Huh? Did you say something?
 No! You’re slick, Kakashi!
 Why are you always so avant-garde?!
 Both of you, to the middle!
 Begin!
 So this is the sandKakashi told me about…
 Please don’t get so mad…
 Mother…
 What’s he talking about…?
 Earlier… Earlier I had you suckawful-tasting blood.
 I’m sorry.
 But this time it’ll likely…
 taste good.
 His conversation’s started.This is dangerous.
 This is the first time I’ve seen Gaaraget like that before fighting.
 So it must mean his opponentis that imposing…
 Him.
 It appears he’s calmed down.
 Come on.
 Hey…
 Do you remember…what he said yesterday?
 At that time…
 I will kill…you all without fail.
 Just wait.
 That’s what he said…
 But he didn’t do it.
 It was the perfect opportunity, but…
 he didn’t even see us.
 Now, let me feel it!
 We're…
 unsatisfactory for him.
 Right now, the only one whocan make him feel anything…
 …is only Sasuke!
 I live fighting for only myselfand loving myself…
 And if I see that all other peoplein this world
 exist only to make me realize that,
 there could be no world more wonderful.
 Naruto…
 Here we go!
 The Sand Shield becamea Sand Clone!
 He’s fast! This guy…is just like that guy…
 He’s fast! It’s nearly the sameas Lee’s ordinary speed.
 And…
 It's overlapping with the image…
 of my Taijutsu!
 Is that the Sand Armor?
 Come on!
 Thank you, Anbu man.
 So apparently, Hinata will beall right for now if she rests.
 Oh, is that right?
 Huh? You know this person?What‘re you taking about?
 This person is an Anbu…
 Not that, but at the examination…?What do you mean?
 Well, this is what it means…
 Come on!
 If you’re not gonna come at me,I’ll go at you!
 He’s fast!
 What’s the matter? Is that it?
 A-Amazing…
 That armor…I’ll tear it off.
 His speed is basically the sameas Lee’s with the weights removed.
 It’s… It’s exactly likeLee’s Taijutsu.
 His speed is also completelydifferent from before!
 Sasuke… You are indeeda genius beyond imagination.
 How many years did it take meto attain that speed…?
 And you attained it in a mere month…!
 However, it seems to consumea lot of stamina
 to continue that movement.
 What’s Gaara planning to do?
 The sand armor uses up toomuch Chakra…
 It can’t last for very long.
 What the heck sort of trainingdid you do?!
 Hm?
 To get to that level in a mere month…
 Sasuke had copied Lee’s Taijutsuwith Sharingan.
 So during the Taijutsu training…
 I had Sasuke image Lee’s movements.
 Sasuke could makethat movement his own
 only because he knew Lee.
 Of course, Sasuke had towork very hard for it.
 But…with only that…
 With only Taijutsu…that Sand guy can’t be taken down!
 That Kakashi…
 He must have seen the battle
 between the hateful Gaaraand the lovable Lee.
 Taijutsu that was taught suddenly
 can’t work against an opponentthat even Lee couldn’t take down.
 He should have known this only to well.
 So if that’s the case…
 Why is it that he had Sasukemaster only Taijutsu?!
 Why did I keep living?
 But as long as you’re alive,you need a reason…
 If you don’t have one,it’s just the same as being dead.
 What's this guy saying?!
 So this is the answer I came to…
 I am living in order to killhuman beings other than myself.
 After living in the fear of never knowingwhen I might be murdered,
 finally, I became calm.
 Oh?
 Shikamaru…
 We need to go over to whereKakashi Sensei is right now!
 What’re you planning to do?
 Hey!
 I'm going to…
 stop this match!
 Gaara couldn’t possibly be planningto use that Jutsu!
 So he used all the sand for protection…
 I didn’t think there could be thismuch of a difference in the hardness
 with a difference in the densityof the sand.
 So it’s absolute protection.
 The sand…lt’s covered his entire body.
 This is somewhat troublesome.
 Now, how will Sasuke proceed?!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Naruto!
 Huh? What do you want?
 Sensei!Please stop this match right away!
 That guy is totally different from us!
 He’s not normal!
 Naruto… 					What’re you saying?
 He lives to kill people.
 In any case…
 If this continues, Sasuke will die!
 Jin, Saru,
 Ne, Saru, Tori, Tatsu, Ne, Saru…
 There’s no mistake about it.lt’s that Jutsu!
 This isn’t good!Our plan isn’t even on Gaara’s mind.
 Shoot!

 Sasuke, when I fought you once, I said
 Even if one understands visually,
 it's meaninless unless onecan move physically.
 I was filled witha sense of superiority.
 But now, you have a body that movesat the same high speed as mine.
 Moreover, you have…Sharingan!

 Yes!

 No chance a half-baked Genjutsu wouldwork on us fully trained Ninja!
 Stop!
 – Huh?– Let go, let go! Let me go!
 Jeez!
 – Naruto! 					– Let go!
 Release!
 What?! Sakura…
 Morning…
 It’s because you charge rightinto an enemy’s Jutsu on your own.
 Oh! Kurenai Sensei and Yakumo?!
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Who’re these people?!
 All four of them have been caught ina Genjutsu and are unconscious.
 Kurenai Sensei!
 S-Sensei… Kurenai Sensei!
 She’s nowhere to be found!
 Byakugan!
 What is it?!
 K-Kurenai Sensei has…
 There's one left…
 Just like that…To think they’d cast a Genjutsu on me.
 Release!
 What?! It won’t wear off?!
 It’s Unkai who served asthe replacement leader
 of the Kurama Clanafter my father died.
 Unkai from the Kurama Clan…I see.
 Things won’t go as they didwith the others, eh?
 Kurenai Yuhi, Genjutsu user.
 I’m embarrassed to be praised by you…
 I’d like to avoid needless battle.
 Hand over Yakumo.
 Hang on tight.
 You may very well beKurenai Yuhi,
 but how do you intentto fight within my Jutsu?!
 Oh, no!
 Damn you!
 I smell blood!
 Heh. I won’t let you escape…
 There!
 Next, I’ll pierce your heart…
 Hand over Yakumo.Why do you protect her?!
 Kurenai Sensei!
 I won’t let you touch Kurenai Sensei!
 Look out!
 Wha--?! Not again!
 Geez, when will youever learn, Naruto?!
 Byakugan!
 Naruto! The enemy’s above you!
 Huh?!
 Byakugan, huh?!
 If you’re coming at mewith Genjutsu, then…
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Go!
 Clones, huh?!
 Heh! Mine aren’t just illusions.
 Let’s go!
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 U-zu-ma-ki!
 Naruto Barrage!
 I’ll definitely get Yakumo…
 Byakugan!
 Yakumo has been sedated to calmher nerves and is asleep now.
 But it would be best for her
 to have a complete examinationback at the village hospital.
 It was a big help havingyou here, Sakura.
 You should also getsome first-aid treatment, Sensei.
 Right… Thanks.
 Okay, please show me.
 They’ve been like this the whole time.
 It doesn’t look like they’ll wake upfrom the Genjutsu
 for quite a while…
 Well, I guess that servesour interests better. Hm?
 It’s…!
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Oh! Thank goodness you look okay!
 Y-Yes…
 She’s not okay!
 Wha--?!
 I gave her some first-aid treatment,but she has a deep wound.
 We must get back to the village quickly…
 Don’t worry about me.
 I’m more concerned aboutYakumo’s instability.
 Yeah, their comrades couldvery well return.
 I’m also concerned about
 how we haven’t seen the three peoplewho were assigned to guard Yakumo.
 All right!
 Leave this to me and all of youhead back to the village
 with Kurenai and Yakumo!
 Organize a back-up unit.
 Your opponents are practitionersof Genjutsu.
 Will you be okay alone?
 What?
 This fully…
 …trained body!
 I would cram by the likesof the Kurama Clan’s Genjutsu!
 A pun?
 Oh?
 Are you awake?
 Hey, do you resent Kurenai Senseifor sealing your Genjutsu?!
 That person hates me…
 She didn’t want to make me intoa practitioner of Genjutsu.
 It’s not like that!
 Then…why?!
 I’m sure she had some kindof reason!
 You would’ve been in troublehad Kurenai Sensei
 not risked her life to save you before!
 That was the Kurama Clan…People from the same clan as me.
 What?
 Why would peoplefrom the same clan as you…?
 Kiba, could you take Kurenai Senseiback to the village?
 I’m fine…I can at least do that myself.
 Kiba?!
 Hey, Kurenai Sensei?!
 Tell us the truth!
 Isn’t this incident and youquitting our squad…
 somehow related?
 The Kurama Clan intowhich Yakumo was born…
 was once a force inthe Village Hidden in the Leaves
 as a family of Genjutsu users.
 However, they had been broughtto ruin in recent years,
 unable to turn out Chunin and Jonin.
 Then a rising star brimming withtalent appeared in the clan.
 And that was Yakumo.
 My parents and relatives placedtheir hopes in me,
 the only daughter ofthe head family.
 But I was in poor health andmy official entrance into the Academy
 was not acknowledged.
 I had wanted to live upto the expectations
 of my parents and the clan…
 and I got really depressed.
 My father saw me like that
 and negotiated directly withthe Third Hokage for me.
 The Third Hokage whomMurakumo consulted
 realized the high level ofYakumo’s latent power
 and decided to leave herin my custody.
 By the order of the Third Hokage,
 Kurenai Sensei becamemy personal teacher.
 But…
 Y-Yakumo?!
 Kurenai Sensei… She…!
 Why?!
 I don't know.
 Maybe since I’m a Genjutsu user too,
 I got jealous of the high levelof Yakumo’s latent powers.
 Jealous…?!
 Genjutsu practitioners withhigher powers than mine
 are not necessary in this village.
 No way. You’d do that fora reason like that…?
 You understand, don’t you?
 A selfish person like me can’t continueto go on missions
 with your lives entrusted to me.
 I can’t believe that!
 It’s not just her…I’m a hindrance to the Leaf Village.
 Wh-What do you mean?
 I just can’t believe it.
 Isn’t Kurenai Sensei still hidingsomething from us…?
 I also…get that feeling.
 Exactly.
 It’s because…
 Kurenai Sensei’s hand shookwith heartache
 when she talked about eventsin the past.
 But the shaking stopped…when she talked about her motive.
 What do you mean?
 That motive is a lie.
 The heart is not affected bya made-up story.
 Then her being jealous of Yakumo…
 Perhaps she’s protecting someone.
 Someone so importantKurenai Sensei would protect?
 That would be, for example…
 I overheard Kurenai Senseiand the Third Hokage talking.
 Yakumo’s powers probablywill not awaken for a long while.
 I see. But the time will eventually come
 when the dam bursts andher powers will pour out.
 That power of the Kurama Clanwill eventually threaten
 the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 At that time,we’ll have to eliminate it.
 Even the Third Hokage wasinvolved with the sealing of my powers.
 The Third Hokage wouldnever order something like that!
 My parents died just before
 I started training underKurenai Sensei.
 There was a sudden fire.
 It seems the fire spread quicklyand they couldn’t be saved…
 But my parents were even Jonin!
 To think they would diejust in a fire.
 And a fire in broad daylighton top of that…
 And after that, although I was toldthere was no foul play…
 the autopsy reports wereclassified and sealed.
 No way?!lt wasn’t just an ordinary fire?
 My parents were killed onorder of the Third Hokage…!
 No way…!No way could that ever be true!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 The story I heard from the girl.
 The story I heard fromKurenai Sensei.
 Which one is true?lt’s unlikely that they’re all lying.
 But I can say this.
 There’s no way the Third Hokagewould think about eliminating the girl.
 For the time being,
 I’ve got to get Sensei andthe others to the hospital quick--!
 What’s this?!

 Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
 Withdraw! You’re not suitedto being a Shinobi.
 You don’t have the privilege ofdeciding what a person is like, stupid!
 Hinata, give it to him!
 Naruto…
 Don’t just take it! Argue back!
 I’m getting irritated watching this!
 Naruto...
 Thank you!
 The expression of her eyeshas changed...
 So you're not going to withdraw?
 I’m not taking responsibilityfor what happens…
 I don’t want to run away!
 Byakugan!
 Brother Neji! I challenge you!
 Here!
 A Failure Stands Tall!
 As I thought, this is the extent of it…
 the head family’s power!
 What the--?!
 But Hinata laid a perfect strike!
 N-Not yet…
 What's with this guy…!
 I-It can't be….
 Well, now….
 I guess this is why he's calledthe most gifted of the Hyuga clan yet.
 Y-You mean… All this time…?
 That's right! I can seethe Chakra Points.
 W-What is he talking about?!
 On the Chakra Network…
 there are 361 energy centersor Chakra opening,
 each about the sizeof the head of a pin.
 They're called Chakra Points.
 Theoretically, hitting one directlycan halt or increase Chakra flow,
 enabling one to gain complete control overan opponent's flow of Chakra.
 Just so you know,
 not even my Sharingancan see Chakra Points!
 Having the penetrating eyeis one thing,
 but to hit it so accurately likethat during a match,
 well, that's just…
 Lady Hinata...
 What we have here is an unchangeabledifference in abilities.
 It's what distinguishesthe elite from the failure.
 It is brute, unalterable fact.
 You were destined to regret having said
 that you don't want to run anymore, the instant you said it.
 And now, you must haveabandoned yourself to despair!
 This is your ultimatum…
 Withdraw!
 I-I...
 I-I meant it...
 and am…sticking by…
 every word...
 Hinata…
 I said!
 I'm not gonna run away!
 Because that's…my Way of Ninja!
 I had no idea... Hinata was this tough…
 She's a lot like you.
 Come to think of it…She's always watching you.
 Huh?
 Hinata…
 Bring it on!
 She has reached her limit.
 One more blow and…
 Neji's hits to Hinata's Chakra Points
 have completely haltedher flow of Chakra.
 That means she can no longersend Chakra
 into her opponent's bodyto fight in the Gentle Fist.
 This match is as good as over.
 But I never imagined there wouldbe someone this powerful…
 I'm afraid even our Sasukeis no match for him.
 It looks as if Neji may very welltake this Exam.
 It's going to take more than whatthis girl has to bring him down.
 L-Look at those eyes…
 Is he going to try to kill her?No, no, that's absurd.
 Doesn't it seem that…
 Neji’s strength is somehowagainst the rules?
 He's just too powerful…
 I mean it!
 Go, Hinata!
 Naruto...
 Strength has come backinto her eyes…
 I've been watching you…
 I've been watching you closelyfor many years now!
 Why I wonder…?
 Next up is Naruto Uzumaki!
 What a pain!
 It's all your fault!
 Like I care!
 Okay!
 Naruto… d-do your best.
 Transformation!
 I don't know why, but…
 I am Naruto Uzumaki!
 I'm not about to lose tothe likes of any of you!
 Is that perfectly clear?!
 I'm not about to lose tothe likes of any of you? Yeah, right!
 That idiot.
 He made a roomful of enemiesin the space of an instant.
 When I watch Naruto...
 Naruto, stand up!
 If you compete with mefor the name of Hokage…
 You… will be the loser!
 I can feel courage welling up.
 I feel that I can hang on,that I can do it…
 that I too am worth something!
 Oh!
 – No! 					– Hinata!
 Hinata...
 At some point, Hinata, who wasin the habit of just giving up,
 made up her mind to change.
 Hey, Hinata. It's time to go home.
 She put every ounce ofher being into her training.
 I saw it with my own eyes.
 But even so, she continuedto fail all her missions.
 She lost her nerve whenfaced with real competition
 and became easily discouraged.
 But today's Hinata is different.
 I have never…
 seen…that look in her eyes before.
 Naruto.
 I have always donethe watching up to now,
 but, now, finally…
 finally, I am…
 Naruto!
 You just don't get it, do you?
 Your strikes were ineffectivefrom the very first.
 It's the end.
 Hinata… That's enough.
 You lost the match,
 but you've become a new personin the process.
 You did well.
 I want to change that about myself…
 So I proposed it myself…
 Neji's final blow wentstraight for the heart.
 I feel sorry for her,
 but she won't be standingagain now.
 As further fighting is not feasibleunder these conditions…
 Don't stop it!
 Don't stop the match!Believe it!
 Naruto, stop!
 What on earth are you saying, stupid!
 She's had it. You can seeshe's unconscious…
 Huh?
 Why do you stand up?
 If you continue like this,you’ll really die!
 He is now finally forthe first time truly seeing me.
 I will not be caught looking bad...
 Why?!
 in front of...
 the person I admire most.
 I-I am far from finished!
 Give up the bravado…
 I can tell you're justbarely standing.
 You've shouldered the lotof having been born
 to the head family line of the Hyuga…
 And cursed and blamedyourself for being weak...
 But, people cannot change.
 That's just the way it is.
 There is no need for youto suffer any more!
 Surrender to it!
 You're wrong... Brother Neji.
 Because I can tell…
 that you are sufferingmuch more than I.
 What?!
 You are the one who is torn up
 over the fate of headand branch family.
 Neji, the match has been called!
 Oh boy!
 Neji, get a hold of yourself!
 You promised me
 you wouldn't let the head familything get you riled up!
 Why are all the other Joninbutting in?!
 The head family getsspecial treatment, eh?
 Hinata?!
 Hinata!
 Hinata!
 Hinata!
 Hinata! Are you okay?!
 Hey!
 Naruto…
 Yeah.
 I…
 Do you think…
 I…changed maybe a little bit?
 Hey you, failure!
 I have two piecesof advice for you.
 First, if you intend tocall yourself a Shinobi,
 stop that revolting cheering of yours.
 And the second...
 a failure will always be a failure.
 There's no changing that!
 Do you want to see about that?
 You!
 Naruto, I get where you'recoming from, believe me.
 But all fighting must bedone officially in a match!
 The failure beats the gifted geniusthrough sheer effort…
 Wouldn't that make foran exciting main battle?
 Though, I am probably goingto be the one fighting Neji…
 but it would be okay with meif you ended up fighting him, Naruto.
 All right already.
 So this is okay then,right, Guy Sensei?
 Lee! You….
 Nice going!
 Oh, no! She's gone into ventricle fib.
 Was he trying to kill her then?!
 The precious little time you havewould be better spent
 seeing to her than glaring at me.
 Medics!
 Hurry! What's taking so long?!
 S-Sorry.
 Get her on the stretcher.One, two, three.
 It's serious. She 's got about10 minutes at the most!
 Get her to the emergency room.Pronto!
 Out of the way!
 Hinata…
 Because that's my Way of Ninja.
 I promise you.
 I will win no matter what!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.

 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy

 The Absolute Defense of the Sand?
 They say no one hasever injured Gaara.
 He's strong as heck andhas no weak points.
 Bushy-Brows is no match for him…
 But wait, he's not losing!
 He seems a lot faster than before.
 Is this due to his training?
 I am getting excited about it!

 Please take this medicine quickly.

 Just as I get back,I have to clean the room.
 Please make sure you to takeyour medicine.
 I don't need that kindof lip service.
 It's medicine that I prescribed.
 The pain should subsideat least slightly.
 The pain on this armthat seems to burn…
 I never thought that it causethis much suffering.
 Sarutobi…known as Third Hokage.lt's his last curse, after all.
 Enough of the talking…
 More importantly,has that individual been found?
 Yes… She seems to be at a placecalled Tanzaku Town.
 Tanzaku Town…
 Is that so…?
 But the opponent is one of the Sannin,the Legendary Three Ninjas.
 It won’t be that simple.
 Good medicine tends to taste bitter.
 Here.
 It’s the same one…But this is the trick?
 You’re the type who was yelled atat the academy
 for not having concentration, right?
 That doesn’t have anythingto do with me now.
 Look at this paper.
 Uh?
 I’ve seen it.
 Fine, then.
 Look at it again.
 Hmm?
 So what is this?
 It’s not something thatI need to explain in length,
 but when you first lookedat this blank piece of paper,
 you just glanced atthe whole thing, correct?
 Probably.
 Then where do you look on this one?
 Most likely the point in the middle?
 When a human being looks atjust a blank piece of paper,
 he doesn’t know where to look,so the eyes wander.
 But if you put even a single point on it,
 the mind focuses there…
 This is concentrating at a single pointand as you focus your mind,
 you become spiritually stable andyou are able to extract unexpected power.
 Huh?
 When you opened a holeon the rubber ball,
 you must have beenconcentrating desperately
 to fill up the Chakrain the palm of your hand.
 Yeah, yeah.
 When you concentrate,power emerges.
 But without a target,it is difficult to concentrate.
 That’s why we have this…
 Listen Naruto, from now on,
 when you store up the Chakrayou build in your right hand,
 try to store it up by concentratingon that mark.
 Concentrate…
 All right, I’ll try it!

 Concentrate!
 Darn it. It’s not supposed to be like this.
 It has to break like “pang.”
 Concentrate!
 Hello… I’d like to make a little inquiry.
 Dang it.
 Concentrate.
 Concentrate!
 No good.
 Dang it. What does it meanto concentrate?!
 Damn you, Sarutobi!
 All right then…
 I’m going again to gathersome information.
 What…? But you just came.
 I don’t have any time to waste.
 Hey, hey…!
 Isn’t there going to be evena little soulful game of catch
 between the master and pupil?
 You scoundrel.
 Strike!
 Here,  the game of catch is over.
 See you later.
 Humph… I’ll forget about that Pervy Sageand work hard by myself.
 That’s the only way, Naruto…
 You have to do this training alone.
 You have the ability to approachthe Fourth Hokage’s level…
 Grasp it by yourself!
 Hmm… Never seen her.
 If that’s the case…
 Sorry to bother you.
 I know the person.
 As well as where she is right now.
 I’ll buy you a drink.
 There’s no need.I was able to win a tidy sum…
 Thanks to that lady.
 Yeah…you are indeedthe Legendary Sitting Duck.
 She lost again, huh.
 Her losses started to pile up…
 So she was talking aboutchanging her location.
 Where to?
 One of the Sannin, Lady Tsunade,is staying at Tanzaku Town over there.

 Yay…it’s “fever” again!
 A person like me pullsa big hit like this…
 I have a bad premonition.
 I also have some knowledgeregarding Lady Tsunade…
 I did use to be part ofthe Medical Corps, after all.
 She was the first person to proposewhat is now an accepted practice
 of assigning one medical specialistto a small squad of four.
 This was a very revolutionary- idea…
 A small combat unit that doesn’teven have emergency medical skills,
 what would happen to them in a battlefieldis clearer than seeing fire.
 Countless experiences in war
 simply became knowledgeto equip themselves with.
 Many who were sacrificedled to the creation of that style.
 A person understands the natureof things for the first time
 after losing them.
 And the thing created byone of the legendary Sannin,
 who is known as the medical specialist
 is that sacrifice.
 Not working…
 I got to concentrate even more.
 Concentrate, concentrate.
 Concentrate, concentrate.
 Concentrate!
 Concentrate…
 Concentrate on one point.

 Strike!
 That stupid perve’s face floats upin my head
 and I can’t even concentrate.
 Oh boy…

 What’s the matter?
 Your winning this much is like a miracle…
 But you don’t look pleased at all.

 Huh?
 I get a bad premonition.
 We’re going to hurry up and leave.
 But this is a tourist resort…

 Then we’re going to hurry upand see it so we can leave.

 I got to do it.
 Ouch!
 Ouch… It hurts so much,I can’t even build up my Chakra…

 Just a bit…just a bit more rest.
 Hey!
 You guys, we’re in class right now.
 You…fools!
 You guys have no concentration at all…!
 This is not the way tobecome fine Ninja.
 How can we stay still at a table,right, Akamaru?
 I’m hungry.
 Sensei, if it’s a scolding,do it quickly.
 What the--?! You, you guys…
 From now, we will havean after-school lesson
 to teach you guys more concentration!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 What’s this?
 You guys are going to do from now
 what the predecessors ofthe Leaf Village
 used to perform every dayas a concentration method!
 It is training to build up Chakra
 by concentrating your entire energyon the leaf on your forehead.
 It’s an ancient way of learning
 how not to become distractedfrom anything else
 by concentrating on a single point,the leaf.
 The one who hones his concentration is truly a great Ninja…
 This is the origin of the Leaf Symbolon the headband.
 That sounds like a lie.
 Aren’t you making that story upto force us to try harder?
 I’m not making this up!lt’s a true story.
 Anyhow, can you really becomea great Ninja
 by just polishing your concentration?
 At any rate,a great Ninja is a guy who’s strong.
 Hey, you have a point.
 This stuff…
 Bye, bye Sensei!
 Hey, hey, you guys wait a minute.
 – We won’t wait!– We don't have time for that!
 Hey! You misfits!
 This is the same thing.
 I should have paid more attentionto what Iruka Sensei was saying…
 I’m so stupid.
 But nothing will startif I just keep on regretting.
 All right, I’m going to master this!
 Concentrate, concentrate…
 Concentrate!
 Wow! Tanzaku Castle sure does havea commanding presence!
 It’s worth being designatedas the cultural heritage.
 Don’t dally…
 We’re going to hurry upand leave this town.
 Lady Tsunade, please look more carefully…
 It costs nothing to view.
 Lady Tsunade?
 What is this chill?
 Now!
 What a kid…
 Raising the density in Chakrato the point that it burns the palm.
 He never ceases to amaze me.
 It broke.
 Good! The second step seems to be complete.
 Hurry… The third step.
 That will come later.
 We’ll now go meet Tsunade.
 That’s…
 Orochimaru.
 I found you.
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered,let us stay true
 Over and over,we hung on without giving up
 Over and over,we kept coming back up
 Over and over,we believed and dreamed
 Over and over,we've seen fools
 I can master the third step while walking?Give me a break!
 Fool! If we don't hurry it up,we'll lose Tsunade!
 Besides, she's short-temperedand impatient!
 Where are we heading?
 If she's here in this town, we'll justlook for her from somewhere high up.
 – So we'll climb up a castle.– Castle?!
 – Can't you see over there?!– Which way is ""over there""?
 I'm saying…
 Oh! What the--?!

2,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Hey, you!
 Are you sure you wantto look like that?
 Yes, of course!C'mon! So hurry hurry!
 Don't regret it later.
 Say cheese!
 My Name Is Konohamaru!
 I couldn't decide on how to look.
 It took me 3 hours to decide.
 But as you can see,it's more like a work of art.
 Doesn't it look great?
 Take it over.
 What?!
 Take it over.
 Stop saying that!
 Transform!
 Oh please, Lord Hokage…
 The Sexy Jutsu…That's quite a devious technique.
 By the way Naruto,where's your headband?
 I won't wear it until the orientation.lt might get scratched
 Well, that's just fine.
 But the Ninja Registration Formis a very important document
 held in high regard by our village.
 Why do you want to look like this?
 Because!
 Anyway, how should I knowabout all that stuff?
 Old man!Get ready to fight!
 I am going to be the Fifth Hokage!
 Ouch!
 If it's not one thing, it's another….
 Drat! Is this a trap?
 Are you okay,Honorable Grandson?
 May I just inform you thatthere aren't any traps here…
 Huh? What's with this runt?
 What?!
 I know this kid…He's that Nine-Tailed boy!
 He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel!
 You must have done this to me!
 You tripped all by yourself, stupid!
 Hey! Let go of him!
 He is the Honorable Grandsonof the Third Hokage!
 He stopped as soon ashe learned who I am….
 He's like my four-eyed teacher.
 He's just like everyone else!
 What's the matter?
 Weren't you gonna hit me, huh?
 Can't do it 'cuzI'm the Hokage's grandson, eh?
 As if I care! 					lmbecile!
 This guy…
 What?!
 Good grief…
 Listen to me.
 You are the Honorable Grandsonof the Third Hokage.
 Even though that scoundrel hit you,you must not associate with his kind.
 Nothing good will come ofyour tangling with him.
 This is your distinguishedteacher Ebisu,
 and I am never wrongabout these things!
 Don't you want to becomethe Fifth Hokage?
 Then allow meto teach you Ninjutsu,
 so that your dream willbecome a reality.
 That's right.
 Stick with me and you will gain a shortcuttowards becoming the Fifth Hokage.
 Is that clear, Honorable Grandson?
 He's gone!
 It seems he's gone after Naruto.
 Oh no!
 This is terrible!
 Honorable Grandson!
 How did he become like this?
 That was the 20th sneak attack today.
 And now he's in the company of Naruto.I'm a bit worried.
 I just hope he doesn't pick upmore foolishness.
 Huh?
 Stop following me!
 What is it now?!
 Your camouflage is pathetic.
 You've seen through my disguise...
 Your reputation is well-earned.
 I will allow you to make meyour apprentice.
 But you must first teach me that ""Sexy Jutsu""  technique
 you used to beat Grandpa Hokage.
 You gotta be kidding.
 I beg you to say yes, boss!
 Huh?
 Boss?
 Boss! Boss! Boss!
 I guess I have no choice.
 Listen.
 In order to become a skilled Ninja,
 you must first learn tocontrol your Chatora.
 Chatora?
 Yes, Chatora.
 Boss, I think you mean Chakra.
 Silence!
 That's what real Ninjas call it!
 Oh! I didn't know that!
 Whew… I'm glad he's a fool.
 Listen. Chakra essentially means…
 Basically, it is the energy neededin order to use Jutsu.
 Huh?
 In other words, fundamentally Ninja Artscombine the Chakra,
 the physical energy accumulatedfrom each cell in the body
 with spiritual energy intensifiedthrough training and experience.
 This combined energy is summonedwith certain hand signs.
 You made me thinkyou knew all that,
 when you were just readingfrom a scroll!
 Much has been said aboutperfecting the Ninja techniques,
 but it really boils downto just one thing.
 And what is that?
 Hard work and guts.
 Hard work and guts?
 That's right.
 So be ready for the challenging tasksI will give you.
 Yes, boss!
 Good. Let's start right now.Transform for me.
 Huh?
 Let me see firsthow much you already know.
 But what do I transform into?
 OK... First, transform into that lady.
 An easy task, boss.
 Transform!
 Well, do I look like her?
 Uhm… Well, the clothes do and…
 And what's so similarabout that?!
 Honorable Grandson.
 If you will transform into me,at least try to look a little cuter, OK?
 She's scary!
 Why am I the one who gets hit?
 OK!Next, we'll do some research on sexiness!
 Yes, boss!
 I told you I don't allowreading here, Naruto!
 This is the last test.Put all of your effort into it!
 Yes, boss!
 Transform!
 Naruto! It's you again!
 Why is it always me…?
 Sorry.
 Huh?
 It's becauseI'm the Hokage's grandson.
 Don't worry about it.
 Huh?
 You're now ready to performthe Sexy Jutsu!
 You just need more practice.
 Yes, boss!
 OK, keep in mind…the point is for ""boom boom boom""!
 Now do it!
 Yes, boss! 					Transform!
 What do you think?
 That won't do!
 More slender.
 Yes, boss!
 Is this okay?
 Not yet. 					More attractive.
 Yes, boss!
 How about now?
 That Naruto… What is he teachingthe Honorable Grandson…?
 Where the hell could they be…?
 I am a distinguished teachertraining potential Hokage.
 All those who interferewill be eliminated.
 You know I've been wondering…
 You seem obsessed with beatingyour Grandpa Hokage.
 My name is Konohamaru.
 It was Grandpa who gave methat name.
 He named me after our village.
 It should be easy for everyonehere to remember.
 But nobody ever calls meby that name.
 When they see me, all they seeis the grandson of Lord Hokage.
 No one sees me for who I really am.
 I can't stand it anymore.
 That's why…
 That's why I want the titleof Lord Hokage now.
 Idiot…Who do you thinkwill accept you, huh?
 Huh?
 You won't win the titlethat easily, you know.
 What?!
 It's not that simple.
 If you're really serious about gainingthe title of Lord Hokage…
 What?
 You'll have to beat me first!
 Lord Hokage!I've been looking for you.
 Iruka.
 Did Naruto re-submithis Ninja Registration Form?
 Yes.
 When I lectured to him the other nightat the ramen stand,
 he said he will make everyone accept himnow that he's a Ninja.
 He's been happy since then.
 It might not be easy for Narutoto realize that dream.
 Huh?
 As you well know,
 only the villagers who foughtthe Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago
 know that the monster is sealedinside Naruto.
 I ruled that no one shall speakabout that incident.
 I have severely punished thosewho have broken this rule.
 Now our children know nothing about it.
 That is the only positivedevelopment for Naruto.
 Before the Fourth Hokage trappedthe monster and died,
 his last wish was for the villagersto regard Naruto as a hero.
 A hero?
 The Fourth Hokage sealed the monsterinto the navel of a newborn baby
 whose umbilical cordhad just been cut.
 As the receptaclefor the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,
 Naruto saved the village.
 Unfortunately, the other villagersdon't see him like that.
 Some even say that Naruto isthe Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself.
 Little by little, that attitude has beenpassed down to their own children.
 Iruka. 					Do you know?
 What, sir?
 When someone is hated and people refuseto accept his existence,
 he sees it in the eyesof the people around him.
 I have found you!
 Huh?
 That Demon Fox!!
 That cold look!lt's always like that!
 Honorable Grandson,we have to go now.
 No way!
 I want to beat Grandpa right nowso I can win the title of Lord Hokage!
 Don't get in my way!
 A Hokage must first know about virtue,honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith,
 judgment, obedienceand all that.
 He must be skilled at more thanthousand techniques…
 And then...
 Transform!
 Take this! Sexy Jutsu!
 What? 					lt didn't work!
 What kind of adisgraceful spell is that?!
 I am a gentleman!
 Such vulgar attackswill never work on me!
 Honorable Grandson!That rascal will only make you an imbecile!
 Stick with me and...
 you will gain a shortcuttowards becoming the Fifth Hokage.
 C'mon, let's go!
 No way!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu
 Wow! 					Fantastic!
 Ha! 					That's nothing.
 I am a distinguished teacher.
 I am not as weak as Mizuki.
 Boss…
 Transform!
 Transform!
 Oh, Master Ebisu…
 I call it ""the Harem Jutsu""!
 He combined the Multiple Clones withhis own Sexy Jutsu.
 That's another devious attack.
 I probably won't even survive that one.
 I can't even beat thatfour-eyed teacher of mine!
 I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly!I want to be recognized by everybody!
 But I keep failing.
 You think it's that easy?
 Huh?
 It's given only to the greatest Ninjain the village.
 Everybody must learn to believe in you.
 I've been through a lot already.
 It's been one struggle after another.
 But after all that,I found someone who accepts me.
 I had to go through a lot...Just for one person.
 You had better push yourself.
 For what?
 The path of getting the title,Lord Hokage, is a brutal one.
 There's no such thing as a shortcut.
 If you're really serious aboutattaining the title of Lord Hokage
 You'll have to beat me first.
 Who do you think you are,lecturing me like that?
 I won't be your apprentice anymore.
 From now on, you're my rival.
 Unfortunately for you,tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy.
 Still, I'll consider you an equal somedaywhen we fight for the title of Lord Hokage.
 Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru.
 You still have a long way to goto become a real Ninja.
 Aaah! Why do I have to be inthe same group with Sasuke?
 The guy I hate the most?
 Sakura keeps saying ""Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!""
 and doesn't evenpay attention to me!
 It makes me so mad!I got it! I'm going to pull one on him!
 I'm not gonna let him be so coolin front of Sakura!
 Next Episode: ""Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?""

 I'll laugh with youand live for the moment
 Still that incidentwill continue to trouble you, right?

 Leaving nothing behind,let us share what is left

 Bitter Rivals and Broken Bonds
 It’s a tranquil village as always…
 The security sucks.
 Humph!
 We should just massacre everybodyin such a seedy village.
 Calm down, Sakon.
 We haven’t come here to fight.
 Shut up, you chicken.
 If you’re scared,
 you should just go homeand go to bed already.
 I’m telling you to calm down, Tayuya.
 You understand whatour job is this time, right?
 Let’s go.We escort our special guest.
 Stop it!
 Damn.
 I can’t stop completely.
 Kakashi Sensei?
 Naruto… That thing you just did was…
 What’re you guys doingup on top of the hospital?
 You went a bit too farfor just a fight, you two.
 That Jutsu earlier, no mistake.
 It’s the Rasengan.
 What’s going on?
 How can Naruto use that Jutsu…?
 Were you going to kill Naruto, Sasuke?
 What’re you doing giving yourself overto a sense of superiority?
 The size of the Chidori therewasn’t one to be aimed
 at a comrade of the same village.
 Why such infantile behavior…?
 Sure enough, a reunion with Itachi…
 Sasuke.
 Damn it!
 Naruto…
 How far will you go…?
 Kakashi Sensei…
 Whatever happened to teamwork?
 Was it you…who taught him that technique?
 I think Naruto is still too youngto be handling that Jutsu.
 He could’ve killed Sasukehad something gone wrong…
 Even if it’s a means of resistingthe Akatsuki,
 to think you would teach Narutothat Jutsu…
 Right back at you…
 That Chidori was also considerably hairy.
 But I didn’t think he wasthe kind of kid
 who’d fire that Jutsu at his comrade.
 Or is it that there’s something quitecomplicated between him and that kid?
 Well, all sorts.
 All sorts?
 Quite simply, it’s a relationship
 like the one between youand Orochimaru in the past.
 I see.
 To him, Sasuke is a comradeand a rival at the same time…
 Well, someone he considersan equal.
 Most likely, he couldn’t takeSasuke’s cheap provocation.
 He’s been chasing him…
 Chasing him since the Academy days.
 Are you hurt…
 Scaredy-Cat?
 Sasuke!
 I won’t lose to you!
 For him, it’s neither younor me now…
 More than anyone…
 he wants to be recognized by Sasuke.
 On the other side of the coin…
 Sasuke feels the speed of Naruto’s growthat close range and feels inferior.
 To the extent that he thinkshe himself isn’t growing at all.
 Scaredy-Cat?
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto has gotten strong…
 And Sasuke…
 I’m going to kill a certain man,no matter what.
 Revenge, huh…?
 I wonder if Itachiis frustrating that kid.
 So Sasuke doesn’t wantto acknowledge Naruto.
 If he acknowledges him,
 he just might deny himselfup to this point…
 Rivalry is a difficult thing.
 It’s not a very good trend…
 Maybe I’ll do some scolding.
 Then I leave Naruto to you.
 Well, I have a mission.And there’s the Chidori thing, too…
 Sakura.
 It’s okay. Things can go back to the waythey were in the old days again.
 Cheer up.
 See ya.
 Thanks, Kakashi Sensei.
 Naruto…
 Sakura.
 Don’t interfere with us!
 You are weak.
 Why are you weak?
 It's because you don’t have enough…
 …hate.
 What’ve I been doing…
 up until now?
 He got a nice look in those eyes.
 Shall we go soon?
 What do you think you’re doing?
 If I don’t do this,you’ll run away, right?
 You’re not the typeto listen quietly to lectures.
 As I recall,that’s Kakashi the Copy Ninja.
 Sasuke… Forget about somethinglike revenge.
 What?
 Well, in this businessI’ve seen a stink of guys like you.
 But the final days of those who speakof revenge are never good.
 They’re tragic.
 You’ll only hurt yourself andagonize more than now.
 Even if you succeed in revenge,all that will remain is emptiness.
 Shut up!
 What do you know?
 Don’t talk to me as if you know!
 Well, calm down…
 If you like,
 shall I go and kill the personmost important to you?
 You’ll be able to realize justhow far off you are
 on what you just said.
 Well, I wouldn’t mind if you’d do that.
 Unfortunately, I don’t even haveone person like that.
 Everyone’s already been killed.
 I’ve lived longer than you have…
 The times were not good.
 I know all too wellthe agony of losing something.
 Well, both you and Iaren’t the lucky ones…
 That’s for darned sure.
 But we’re not the worst, either.
 You and I,
 we both have already founddear comrades, haven’t we?
 It’s because I have lostthat I understand.
 The Chidori is a power…
 I gave to you becauseyou now have something important.
 You should know thatit’s not a power
 to be used on your comradeor to use for revenge,
 and I’m sure you knowwhat it should be used for.
 Think hard about whether or notwhat I’m saying is wrong.
 It’ll be tricky with a Shinobiof that level hanging around.
 So let’s wait a bit.
 Maybe jerks like you’d be no good.But I could do it.
 I wonder. “Two”should be ample to rip him apart.
 Don’t be butting in all the time,you clod.
 Tayuya, women shouldn’tuse words like that too…
 Shut up, fatso.
 – More, please!– More, please!
 Wanna head back?
 Sure!
 We both made itto the top of the tree.
 Sakura.
 I have a something to talkto you about.
 I’ll go out on a date with you,so come along.
 Damn it…
 Damn it!
 The Curse Mark left by Orochimaruduring the Chunin Exam…
 Kakashi Sensei saidit was okay now, but…
 Master Orochimaru.
 You didn’t need to send outall four members, did you?
 It seems those kids are all interestedin Sasuke to whom I've taken a liking.
 To see what extent his power is…
 A contest of strength or whatever,
 at this point Sasuke would beno match for them.
 That is precisely why…he will come to mein search of power.
 Who’re you guys?
 I’m Kidomaru, the East Gateof the Sound Ninja Four.
 I’m Sakon,the West Gate of the same.
 I’m Jirobo,the South Gate of the same.
 I’m Tayuya,the North Gate of the same.
 I’m in a bad mood now…
 If you wanna continue to fight her,
 I won’t go easy on you!

 What do you want to eat, Sakura?
 Anything's fine.
 At any rate,Kakashi Sensei's over the top.

 But if Kakashi Sensei hadn't stopped it,right about now…
 Of course, which of us was strongerwould be settled, believe it.
